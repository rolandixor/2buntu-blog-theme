## 2buntu Website Theme

This repository contains the LESS files for the Bootstrap theme used on the 2buntu website.

### Building the CSS Files

You will need the following Ubuntu packages installed in order to build the CSS files:

 - [node-less](http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/node-less)
 - [cssmin](http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/cssmin)

Once these are installed, simply run the following command to build the CSS files:

    make
    
## Why this fork?
- To see if I can create a new theme.
- To integrate Anole (https://rolandixor.pro/anole) with the theme.
